# Creating a Customized Image Filter using Style Transfer

Style Transfer is a machine learning technique that can transform any given image stylized as another! 

This follows the tutorial from [Vijay Subrahmanian at raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/34375110-createml-tutorial-for-ios-creating-a-customized-image-filter-using-style-transfer).

The main objective of the tutorial is to get acquainted with creating a modelling pipeline directly in the iOS app. I found it really interesting to see how the training happens on-device and that you can see some of the packages!!

Enjoy!
